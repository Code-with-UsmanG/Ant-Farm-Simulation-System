# Ant-Farm-Simulation-System
This repository contains the source code for the Ant Farm Simulation project. The simulation models the behavior of ants in a meadow, including battles between colonies and resource management. Features include tick-based actions, species-specific bonuses, and merging of colonies upon queen defeat.
